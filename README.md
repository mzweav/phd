# A Model of Type Theory with Directed Univalence in Bicubical Sets
by Matthew Z. Weaver and Daniel R. Licata

The code in this repository includes formalizations corresponding to the above, as well as some other, related material:
```
  agda/directed/ -- Agda formalization
                    (compile All.agda to check everything)
```

The formalization also includes that from the following paper.

# Cartesian Cubical Type Theory
by Carlo Angiuli, Guillaume Brunerie, Thierry Coquand,
Kuen-Bang Hou (Favonia), Robert Harper, Daniel R. Licata

```
  agda/ -- full Agda formalization
           (compile ABCFHL.agda to check everything)
```

The formalizations were checked by Agda 2.6.1.2, which includes the
'flat' modality that was previously in a special agda-flat branch.
